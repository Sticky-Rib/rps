# Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

A browser-based simulation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors system, where entities interact in a dynamic ecosystem. Built for experimentation, education, and fun.

## Purpose

This project explores emergent behaviour and balance through a simple set of rules. It aims to provide an interactive and visual way to understand concepts like:

- System equilibrium and collapse
- Predator–prey dynamics
- Competitive stability

## Features

- Dynamic canvas animation
- Configurable sprite behaviours (aggression, evasion, etc.)
- Clear visual feedback for dominance and extinction
- Extensible structure for further experiments

## Live Demo

GitHub Pages link: _coming soon_

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Canvas API
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Status

This is an early-stage prototype. Core mechanics are in place. Additional features and tuning in progress.
