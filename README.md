# Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

A browser-based simulation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors system, where entities interact in a dynamic ecosystem. Built for experimentation, education, and fun.

## Purpose

This project explores emergent behaviour and balance through a simple set of rules. It aims to provide an interactive and visual way to understand concepts like:

- System equilibrium and collapse
- Predator–prey dynamics
- Competitive stability

## Features

- Dynamic canvas animation
- Configurable sprite behaviours (aggression, evasion, etc.)
- Visual feedback for behaviour over time, with CSV export

## Live Demo

GitHub Pages link: [https://sticky-rib.github.io/rps/](https://sticky-rib.github.io/rps/)

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Canvas API
- Web Audio API
- Chart.js
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Status

Playable prototype. All core systems are functional. Refinements and polish (e.g. audio cycling, visual tuning) in progress.
